node.model.ts
This file defines two interfaces used in the graph library: NodeOptions and Node. These interfaces specify the structure of the data related to graph nodes, including their properties and optional styling options.

NodeOptions: Defines optional styling properties for a node, such as radius, fill color, and border color.
Node: Represents a node in the graph with an ID, coordinates (x, y), a label, and optional styling options.
